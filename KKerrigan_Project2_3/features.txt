Running Project 2. ut_tokens with all revelant tags set to true should run 5 test cases with no errors
Running Project 3. ut_tokenizer with all revelant tags set to true should run 68 test cases with no errors
Running Project 4. ut_parser with all revelant tags set to true should run 21 test cases with no errors
Running Project 5. ut_rpn_evaluator with all flags except TEST_RESULT(because it isn't used) set to true should run 107 test cases with no errors
Running Project 6. ut_expression_evulator with all flags except TEST_VARIABLE and TEST_RESULT set to true should run 61 test cases with no errors
Running Project ee will open the console window to allow you to put string input in to fully test the program

TEST_TOKENIZER, TEST_PARSER, and TEST_EE stay true for all projects in solution

The only two source files in common with no implementation code are operand.cpp and operation.cpp

I can't remember if you mark in DEBUG or Release mode, but for some reason that I didn't have time to find 41 tests fail in Project 6 in release,
so I am hoping you only mark in debug...

Have a great holiday Lianne, and thank you for the great semester! :)
